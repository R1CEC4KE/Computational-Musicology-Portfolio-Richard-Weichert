# Computational-Musicology-Portfolio-Richard-Weichert
This portfolio comprises of statistical investigations into the genre of **Swancore**, a musical hybrid influenced by post-hardcore, mathcore, funk & RnB and, as of late, mainstream pop. I would like to address questions pertaining to how a push towards a hybridised sound **affects the popularity and demographic diversity of music**, and similarily whether a push towards a "poppier" sound can be both to the **benefit and detriment to the music's reception**. Having done extensive reading, listening and writing on topics ranging from musicology and ethnomusicology to acoustic ecology, and being particularily invested in the Swancore scene, I would like, with this investigation, to combine my interests on a new, statistical frontier.
Artists of interest will include bands **Dance Gavin Dance**, **Royal Coda**, **A Lot Like Birds** and **Stolas**. Knowing the longevity and histories of both Dance Gavin Dance (DGD) and Royal Coda (RC), I expect a far greater demographic diversity and shared audiences with more mainstream artists. This would coincide with their persistance in recent years of departing from their post-hardcore roots and experimenting with a more mainstream sound. On the other hand, knowing the devoted communities still surrounding the now-seperated bands A Lot Like Birds (ALLB) and Stolas, I expect that, despite their less accessible sound, their audience will also be quite geographically widespread (though in the case of all these bands, an intense concentration will be in the regions where they formed, the central and southwestern USA).
In working with some of the larger names and pioneers of this Swancore, this corpus should serve as a relatively solid overview, but consequently will mean that smaller bands and their more recent contributions to the genre will be overlooked. Similarily, because only larger bands within the genre are going to be investigated, there is a portion of listening that will take place offline, whether through frequent live concerts, vynil CD and Cassette, and live radio. Similarily, Spotify is not the only music streaming platform (even if it is the largest), and the larger a band becomes, the larger quantity (though not necessarily ratio, so this can be worked around) of listeners will be listening through other platforms.
Tracks of interest (particularily when comparing a presence/lack of pop, funk and RnB influences and their impact on listening statistics) will be *Feels Bad Man* and *Son of Robot* (DGD), *Connector* and *Vanity's Fair* (ALLB), *Becoming the Memory* and *Even If* (RC) and *Bellweather* and *Time & the Sun* (Stolas).
This being said, click, scroll, read and listen on, and enjoy!
